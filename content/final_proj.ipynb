    "Meta(Facebook), Amazon, Netflix and Google, popularily known as FAANG, have revolutionized and dominated the tech industry for an extended peroiod of time.\n",
    "Their dominance in the markets has led to a significant increase in the number of investors withtin the tech sector. FAANG has not only revolutionized the tech industry, but the industry's dominance in multiple markets including technology and consumer services has led to major increases in a number of elements pertaining to financial growth. Understanding the process of success in the companies is crucial in determining how these companies will succeed in the future\n",
    "With these companies being at the top of the technology market for many years, understanding their revenues and values is key in understanding how these companies rose to the top of the market. Understading the global dominance of these companie is an essential part of this process. Investigating the links below will enable you to furthur delve into this subject. \n",

    "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/faang-stocks-mamaa/\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the surge of FAANG's dominance withtin the tech sector of investment, our project seeks to develop a tool to conduct predictive analysis of Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Google's stock value. Throughout our model, we cover data from the year 2013 up until 2024, utilizing data such as the stock values as well as Fiscal Annual Revenue between the given time frame. In order to develop more comprehensive data, we calculated the year change in the stock prices for each company in order to acquire a a cleaner data set for the sake of more efficient and accurate computations and interpretations of the stocks' performances. \n",
    "The goal of our analysis project is to demonstrate an understanding of how these companies have evolved in terms of their profit and stock pricing. We are accompishing this by utilizing the data that is available to us in order to provide an understanding of how these companies will perform in the future. "

    "In terms of our data collection, we began by collecting data regarding these companies from the past 7 years from May 15, 2017, until May 15, 2024. The respective CSV files are for each company are included. For example, the stock prices for each day including the opening price, highest and lowest price of the day, adjusted closing price, and the volume of shares traded during the day. For the sake of simplicity in interpretation and development of our predictive model, we calculated the change in the price for each year. For that, we utilized the closing price of the last day of the year and subracted it with the opening price of the first day of the year to get the change in price for each year. We utilized the change in price as one of the data as a way to simplify the data making for the sake of  computing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we derived the fiscal annual revenue for each of the companies. We retrieved the table and the values for each company in order to utilize the fiscal annual revenue and the change in stock prices to compute values for our predictive model. It is very difficult to predict future stock prices due to the variety of factors that can cause a drastic price change. However, for we attemoted to account for these by utilizing both the annual revenue to determine how the stock prices could change relative to their presented revenue. We compiled and filtered this data in order to finally computer our predictive model."

From this graph, we can see the increases and decreases in the level of growth for each company in the time frame of 2017-2024. This graph is significant because it enables us to identify the trends as well as spikes that occured as indicators for any potential major or minor shifts in stock values. For exmaple, graphs showing a declining trend could be a major indicator of a slow-growing stock price or decrease in stock price while the other companies containing fluctuations could be an indicator of fluctuations in the stock price. For a true prediction, as many holistic factors would need to be looked. However, for the sake of our predictive model, we belive that the level of growth in the revenue is one of the the main indicators which can help us in making an accurate and efficient predictive model."

    "### Linear Regression Analysis: Predicting Stock Price Change from Revenue Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we are performing a linear regression analysis to predict the change in FAANG's stock price based on the growth percentage of its revenue. Below is a step by step description of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a description for what we did for meta:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "    - We start by creating two DataFrames: `meta_change`, which contains the yearly change in Meta's stock price, and `meta_rev_table`, which contains the yearly revenue, change in revenue, and revenue growth percentage.\n",
    "    - We then merge these two DataFrames on their corresponding date columns (`Date` and `Fiscal Year End`) to create a combined DataFrame that includes both stock price changes and revenue growth percentages.\n",
    "    - From the combined DataFrame, we filter out only the `Change` and `Growth (percentage)` columns to focus on these two variables for our regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Up the Data**:\n",
    "    - The `Growth (percentage)` column is set as the independent variable X which will be considrered the feature. Then we had reshaped to a 2D array.\n",
    "    - The `Change` column is set as the dependent variable X which is the target.\n",
    "    - This table is the main two variables we need to perform the linear regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating and Training the Linear Regression Model**:\n",
    "    - We create an instance of the `LinearRegression` model.\n",
    "    - We train the model using the `fit` method, passing the independent variable X and the dependent variable Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Making Predictions**:\n",
    "    - Using the trained model, we make predictions for the stock price changes based on the revenue growth percentages using the `predict` method.\n",
    "    - We compare the predicted values with the actual values to assess the model's performance visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluating the Model**:\n",
    "    - We evaluate the model's performance by calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R-squared (R²) score using the `mean_squared_error` and `r2_score` functions from scikit-learn.\n",
    "    - The MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, while the R² score indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualizing the Results**:\n",
    "    - We create a scatter plot of the actual data points (stock price changes vs. revenue growth percentages).\n",
    "    - We also plot the regression line (predicted values) to visualize the fit of the model.\n",
    "    - The x-axis represents the revenue growth percentage, and the y-axis represents the change in stock price.\n",
    "    - The plot includes labels, a title, and a legend to distinguish between actual data points and the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we aim to understand how well the growth percentage of Meta's revenue can predict the change in its stock price using a simple linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we did the same steps for each of the other FAANG companies to see how accurate our model is."
